# DNS-Spoofing
This PDF will explain DNS Spoofing - MITM Attack in very details

                                Ettercap & Setoolkit

❖ Overview about the practical
Here, we will clone a site(HTTP OR HTTPs) as a attacker and then spoof the DNS of the victim so when the victim will search or 
try to go on the domain he will be having our clone site same as the original page and user will enter it’s credentials 
and we will get it and by this user will login into its page without getting any idea that he had been attacked by MITM [Man in the Middle].

❖ Requirement to perform the attack
✓ Setoolkit – for Cloning the web page
✓ Ettercap – For performing DNS Spoofing and MITM [Man in the middle] attack

▪ Note: -
▪ This all the task is done within a local network with eth0 or ethernet interface
▪ To perform this task outside the network in real world, try to do port forwarding
▪ Here, we had done this all thing in our same network within the VMs
▪ All the screenshot will be above the summary of the attack
