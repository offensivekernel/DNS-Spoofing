# DNS-Spoofing<br>
This PDF will explain DNS Spoofing - MITM Attack in very details<br>
<br><br>
                                Ettercap & Setoolkit
<br><br>
❖ Overview about the practical<br>
➢ Here, we will clone a site(HTTP OR HTTPs) as a attacker and then spoof the DNS of the victim so when the victim will search or <br>
try to go on the domain he will be having our clone site same as the original page and user will enter it’s credentials <br>
and we will get it and by this user will login into its page without getting any idea that he had been attacked by MITM [Man in the Middle.<br>
<br><br>
❖ Requirement to perform the attack<br>
✓ Setoolkit – for Cloning the web page<br>
✓ Ettercap – For performing DNS Spoofing and MITM [Man in the middle] attack
<br><br>
▪ Note: -<br>
▪ This all the task is done within a local network with eth0 or ethernet interface<br>
▪ To perform this task outside the network in real world, try to do port forwarding<br>
▪ Here, we had done this all thing in our same network within the VMs<br>
▪ All the screenshot will be above the summary of the attack<br>
